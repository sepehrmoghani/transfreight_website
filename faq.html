        <h2>iConsignit</h2>
        <h3>How do I create a consignment?</h3>

            will take you to the training page, with instructional videos and training manuals.</p>

        <p>Click on the green ‘Customer Login’ button in the top right of this page.</p>

        <h3>How do I add more users to my iConsignit login?</h3>
        <p>When you are logged into iCONSIGNIT, click on the ‘information’ icon in the bottom left of the screen, this
            will take you to the training page, where there is a button to ‘Add New User’</p>

        <h3>There is no ETA available for my consignment.</h3>
        <p>Please note that whilst we endeavour to have all transit times available, there will be instances where no
            transit times are available. If you require a transit time urgently, please contact Customer Care on <b>1300
                964 431</b>, email <b>query@transfreight.com.au</b> or through LiveChat.</p>

        <h2>Freight Questions</h2>
        <h3>What do I do if my freight has not been collected?</h3>
        <p>Double check that you have ‘booked and manifested’ your freight, if this has been completed, open an enquiry
            with customer care to inform them that the freight has been missed. Our Customer Care team will rebook
            and monitor the consignment.</p>

        <h3>What are carriers standard delivery times?</h3>
        <p>Carriers deliver within business hours, 9am-5pm. As a rule of thumb deliveries are generally completed in the
            morning, collections are completed in the afternoon.</p>

        <h3>What happens if an item is lost or damaged in transit?</h3>
        <p>Transfreight is not a common carrier and does not insure goods. Insurance is available on each consignment
            sent
            through our platform, however we recommend the sender organises their own marine transit insurance to cover
            for any losses or damages.</p>

        <h3>What is a tailgate delivery?</h3>
        <p>Tailgate delivery means that the driver will bring the item(s) to the back of the truck and lower the item(s)
            to the ground. Please note that carriers have restrictions to the size of an item that can be
            tailgated, generally anything over 220cm and 500kg will not be suitable for a tailgate delivery.</p>

        <h3>How do I consign freight to a depot to be collected by the customer?</h3>
        <p>Simply head to our <a href="#">Depot Location</a> page and find
            the depot closest to your receiver, and use the address as the receivers address. Use the following
            format for the ‘Business Name’ – ‘ABC Plastics C/o TNT Depot’. Make sure you use the end receivers
            ‘Contact Name’ and ‘Number’ on the consignment. Make sure you select the same carrier as you are
            delivering the freight to, eg if you are sending to a TNT Depot, you can only use TNT as the carrier of the
            freight.</p>

        <h3>How do I tell the difference between a business and residential address?</h3>
        <p><strong>Residential Definition:</strong></p>
        <p>The fact that a business is being operated from a location does not qualify it as a commercial address. Any
            business being operated from a home, apartment, or other dwelling where people live on the premises is
            considered to be a residential address.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Definition:</strong></p>
        <p>Commercial addresses are those defined by our freight carrier as commercial sites. Typically these addresses
            are zoned as commercial real estate. Most commercial sites have truck-trailer access and a loading dock.</p>

        <h3>Do you deliver to PO Boxes?</h3>
        <p>Select the ‘PO Box’ tick box when entering your quote/consignment details, the carriers available for PO Box
            deliveries will be shown in the quote. Please note, only Australia Post and Startrack deliver to PO
            Boxes.</p>

        <h3>What is ‘Dead Weight'’?</h3>
        <p>Simply,&nbsp;the physical weight of a consignment.</p>

        <h3>What is ‘Cubic Weight’?</h3>
        <p>Carriers have to find a happy medium between the size of an item and the weight of an item, this is called
            the&nbsp;<strong><em>Cubic Conversion Factor</em></strong>.&nbsp; For instance you may send a box that is
            100 x&nbsp; 100 x 100cm that weighs 5kg, although your box only weighs 5kg, it takes up a large amount of
            space in the truck, therefore you have to be charged accordingly.&nbsp; You may also send a package that is
            15 x 15 x 15cm but weighs 100kg, although your item only takes up a small amount of the truck, it is heavy
            therefore this needs to be taken into account.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that dead weight, cubic weight and charge weight are always rounded up to the next
            whole kg.</p>
        <p>Cubic Weight (Volumetric Weight)</p>
        <p>This is based on the volume of the freight, using the below equation:</p>
        <p><em>L(m) x W(m) x H(m) x ‘Cubic Conversion Factor’</em></p>
        <p>eg.&nbsp; A box with dimensions 40cm x 50cm x 60cm travelling on a service with a 250 cubic will have a cubic
            weight of 30kg:</p>
        <p>0.4 x 0.5 x 0.6 x 250 = 30kg</p>

        <h3>What is ‘Charge Weight'’?</h3>
        <p>This is the greater of the <em>dead weight</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>cubic weight.</em></p>
        <p>eg. <strong>Box 1</strong>. 40cm x 50cm x 60cm, weighing 10kg, travelling on a 250 cubic service –
            charge weight is 30kg (based on volume)</p>
        <p><strong>Box 2</strong>. 40cm x 50cm x 60cm, weighing 40kg, travelling on a 250 cubic service – charge weight
            is 40kg (based on dead weight).</p>
